%Function finds the shortest path from a start point to an end point in a 
%2D arena whilst avoiding obstacles

%OUTPUT:
%Output is in the form of a Nx2 matrix
%Collumns 1 and 2 represent the waypoint  x and y coordinates respectively
%Each row N represents one of the waypoints
%Waypoints sorted from the start point to the end point

%INPUTS:
%Start and end points can either be collumn or row matrices with the first
%and second entries corresponding to the x and y coordinates respectively
%External boundaries is in the form of an Mx2 matrix
%Each of the M rows represent one vertex of the external wall of the arena
%The first and second collumns represent the x and y coordinates of each
%vertex
%NB: The extrnal boundaries will always be taken to form a closed polygon
